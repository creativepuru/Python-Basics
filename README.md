# Python Basics

Hi... I am Purushottam (^.^)

This is my very first GitHub Repository.
I am creating this repo on 11th April 2023.
In this repo, I will be uploading all the python basic projects in two formats ".ipynb" & ".py"

Also you will get Questions related to Python Basics which will help to boost up the knowledge.

Thanks.
