# pythonbasic

Hi... I am Purushottam (^.^)

This is my very first Github Repository.
I am creating this repo on 11th April, 2023.
In this repo, I am practicing python basics from PWSKILLS by Sudhanshu Sir & Krish Sir (iNeuron) & IIT Delhi professors.

I will be uploading all the python basic projects in this repository.

Thanks.
